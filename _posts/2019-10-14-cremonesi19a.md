title: A pragmatic and industry-aware approach toward the design of on-line recommender
  systems
section: Keynote
abstract: On-line recommender systems are designed to address a number of different
  recommendation scenarios in which traditional systems fail primarily, but not only,
  due to scalability issues. The goal of this talk is to give participants an overview
  on the design requirements for on-line recommender systems, with a focus on their
  quality evaluation, and to provide pragmatic guidelines to perform these activities
  more effectively avoiding commons pitfalls. The talk is structured into two parts.
  In the first part, after a general overview of on-line recommender systems, we will
  analyze different application scenarios. In the second part we will analyze possible
  functional and non-functional evaluation problems. We will present some of our works
  on evaluating presentation biases, problems which affect click-based on-line recommender
  systems. We will later present some of our recent work towards comparing the scalability
  of different Top-N recommender systems, understanding their fundamental limitations
  and characteristics for some of the application scenarios identified in the first
  part.
