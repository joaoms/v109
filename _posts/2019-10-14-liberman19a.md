title: Search-Based Serving Architecture of Embeddings-Based Recommendations
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Over the past 10 years, many recommendation techniques have been based on
  embedding users and items in latent vector spaces, where the inner product of a
  (user,item) pair of vectors represents the predicted affinity of the user to the
  item. A wealth of literature has focused on the various modeling approaches that
  result in embeddings, and has compared their quality metrics, learning complexity,
  etc. However, much less attention has been devoted to the issues surrounding productization
  of an embeddings-based high throughput, low latency recommender system. In particular,
  how the system might keep up with the changing embeddings as new models are learnt.
  This paper describes a reference architecture of a high-throughput, large scale
  recommendation service which leverages a search engine as its runtime core. We describe
  how the search index and the query builder adapt to changes in the embeddings, which
  often happen at a different cadence than index builds. We provide solutions for
  both id-based and feature-based embeddings, as well as for batch indexing and incremental
  indexing setups. The described system is at the core of a Web content discovery
  service that serves tens of billions recommendations per day in response to billions
  of user requests
