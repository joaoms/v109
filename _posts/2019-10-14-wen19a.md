title: Practical Lessons from Predicting New User Demographics for Ad Targeting
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Programmatic ad buying, the use of technology to automate and optimize the
  ad buying process in real-time, has been emerging to be the major form of online
  advertising. For each online campaign, advertisers generally want to specify a certain
  group of audience that they want to target at. Among these, demographics (user age
  and gender) is the fundamental and most common targeting option. On the other side,
  due to the huge volume of bid-requests flowing into the exchange, majority of those
  users (i.e. cookies) are either completely new to the ad platform or has too little
  historical behavior information to determine their demographics. In this paper,
  we present and discuss the methods, system and practical lessons in tackling this
  problem at massive scale.
