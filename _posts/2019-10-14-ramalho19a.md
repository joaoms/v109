title: 'Incremental Multi-Dimensional Recommender Systems: Co-Factorization vs Tensors'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: The present paper sets a milestone on incremental recommender systems approaches
  by comparing several state-of-the-art algorithms with two different mathematical
  foundations - matrix and tensor factorization. Traditional Pairwise Interaction
  Tensor Factorization is revisited and converted into a scalable and incremental
  option that yields the best predictive power. A novel tensor inspired approach is
  described. Finally, experiments compare contextless vs context-aware scenarios,
  the impact of noise on the algorithms, discrepancies between time complexity and
  execution times, and are run on five different datasets from three different recommendation
  areas - music, gross retail and garment. Relevant conclusions are drawn that aim
  to help choosing the most appropriate algorithm to use when faced with a novel recommender
  tasks.
